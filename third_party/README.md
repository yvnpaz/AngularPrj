# third_party vendored sources in Angular CLI

Note, other third_party directories under subpackages currently exist to support the legacy pre-bazel build system.

For example, `/packages/angular_devkit/core/third_party`

## TL;DR: don't copy sources into this repo

All sources in this repo should be authored from scratch by the committer.
Don't copy sources you've found in any other location.
